# Problem 3

Select an application written in a language that is supported by an application runtime like Google App Engine Standard Environment or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Alternatively, create a simple application with a health endpoint.
If the service requires a database or other external connection, set up those resources using whichever tool you prefer.
Create a spec file for the application runtime.
Using the cloud providerâ€™s console or CLI, deploy the application using your spec file.
Verify the deployment and that the application is running as expected.

Deliverables
Create an application runtime spec file for the service you choose.
Create a document containing documentation for this process.
Include a step-by-step process for deploying future versions.
Include a section explaining how to verify the service is running as expected.
If you run into issues, add an FAQ section to help avoid them in the future.

# Solution

I'll start with a simple spring boot app that just says Hello World to make this really easy. I used the spring initializer.
